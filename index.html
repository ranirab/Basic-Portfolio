      I enjoy using the techniques learned in the GA Tech Full Stack bootcamp to create beautiful
      web pages.  I was excited to know that this class was offered which would give me the opportunity
      to dive right in and get started on a new career path. <p>I enjoy the diversity of languages.  I have learned and spoken French and spoken Bengali 
      with family and friends.  I had the opportunity to travel with my family to differenct parts 
      of the USA and other countries.  We have enjoyed all our experiences.</p><p> My husband and I have a son and daughter, both in middle school and a small white and black dog, named Oreo.</p>
